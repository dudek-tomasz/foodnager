# Foodnager

## Project Description
Foodnager is a mobile and web application that helps users search for, store, and manage culinary recipes. The application leverages AI to generate or modify recipes based on the ingredients available in a user's virtual pantry. It features user registration and authentication, comprehensive virtual fridge management, and a hierarchical recipe search that prioritizes user-created recipes, followed by API-sourced recipes, with AI-generated recipes as a fallback. Additionally, Foodnager can generate a shopping list of missing ingredients for any selected recipe.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Astro 5, React 19, Typescript 5, Tailwind 4, Shadcn/ui
- **Backend & Database:** Supabase
- **AI Communication:** Openrouter.ai
- **CI/CD & Hosting:** GitHub Actions, DigitalOcean

## Available Scripts
The following scripts are defined in the project's `package.json`:
- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the Astro development server.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the project for production.
- **`npm run preview`**: Previews the production build.
- **`npm run astro`**: Runs Astro CLI commands.
- **`npm run lint`**: Runs ESLint to analyze the code for potential quality issues.
- **`npm run lint:fix`**: Runs ESLint and automatically fixes problems where possible.
- **`npm run format`**: Formats the codebase using Prettier.

## Project Scope
Foodnager focuses on solving the user problem of efficiently finding recipes that match available ingredients. Key functionalities include:
- **User registration and login:** Secure account creation and authentication.
- **Virtual Fridge Management:** Add, edit, view, and delete products from a virtual pantry.
- **Recipe Management:** Create, view, and delete recipes with required (name, ingredients with quantities) and optional (cooking time, difficulty) fields.
- **Hierarchical Recipe Search:** 
  - First, search through user-created recipes.
  - Then, retrieve recipes via an external API.
  - Finally, use AI to generate a recipe if no suitable match is found.
- **Shopping List Generation:** Compare available ingredients against a recipeâ€™s requirements and generate a list of missing items for easy shopping.
